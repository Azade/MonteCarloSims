## MonteCarloSims

### This program calculates the growth of the portfolio using Monte Carlo Simulation approach.

###### inputs:
double initial_investment = 100000,  
double inflation_rate = 3.5/100,  
int period = 20,   
int sims_no = 10000,   
double mean_Aggressive = 9.4324/100,  
double sD_Aggressive = 15.675/100,  
double mean_Conservative = 6.189/100,  
double sD_Conservative = 6.3438/100 

###### outputs:
10th percentile value, 
Median value, 
90th percentile value 

###### Sample outputs:
